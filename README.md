timesheet managment program

It's annoything to keep track of times on an excell sheet. This lets you start and end a work session and records everything in a pickle. Also calcuates earnings and generates a report of all hours worked for timesheet entery. Recently added a basic manual override mode. 

TODO:
- allow adding hours through manual override (currently can only subtract)
- add an optional "what I did" field for each day
- add an interface for saving to different files to archive timesheets. Currently not possible without changeing code in timesheet.py by hand
- banner API?
